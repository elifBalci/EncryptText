Euclid was the author of the most successful mathematics book ever written The Elements which appeared in over  different editions from ancient to modern times Little is known about Euclids life other than that he taught at the famous academy at Alexandria in Egypt Apparently Euclid did not stress applications When a student asked what he would get by learning geometry Euclid explained that knowledge was worth acquiring for its own sake and told his servant to give the student a coin because he must make a profit from what he learns alKhowarizmi an astronomer and mathematician was a

alKhowarizmi wrote books on mathematics astronomy and geography Western Europeans first learned about algebra from his works The word algebra comes from aljabr part of the title of his book Kitab

considered to be the first precise definition of a limit and developed new tests for convergence of infinite series De Morgan was also interested in the history of mathematics and wrote biographies of
